## Abstract
As the global community increasingly turns to renewable energy solutions to combat climate change, hydropower development is often heralded as a sustainable path to economic growth. However, the impacts of hydropower projects on local environments, economies, and political stability—particularly in regions already vulnerable to conflict—remain underexplored. This research seeks to fill this gap by examining the effects of hydropower development shocks on conflict levels in areas with weak governance and pre-existing tensions. Using a difference-in-differences framework, the study uncovers patterns in how hydropower projects influence conflict. While there is variation across different contexts, the most common finding is that, although conflict generally spikes in the immediate aftermath of hydropower development, it tends to decrease over time and remain low in the long term, ultimately reaching levels lower than pre-hydropower conditions. These findings suggest that early-stage instability is a critical factor in the hydro-development-conflict relationship, underscoring the need for policymakers to prioritize stability and inclusive governance during the initial phases of hydropower projects. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how renewable energy projects shape conflict dynamics and opens the door for future research to more specifically explore the mechanisms driving these patterns.
